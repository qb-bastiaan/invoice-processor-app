# CI/CD Enhancement Plan for Invoice Processor App

This document outlines potential improvements and next steps to establish a robust GitOps/CI/CD pipeline for the Invoice Processor application.

## Current Status (Foundational Steps Achieved)

*   **Version Control:** Project is version-controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub.
*   **`.gitignore`:** A comprehensive `.gitignore` file is in place, excluding unnecessary files and sensitive data like `.env.local` and `output-data/`.
*   **Secrets Management (Basic):** API keys and other secrets are managed via `.env.local` (which is gitignored) and an example file (`.env.local.example`) is provided.

## Areas for Enhancement & CI/CD Implementation

The following areas can be addressed to align more closely with GitOps and CI/CD best practices:

### 1. Branching Strategy
*   **Current:** Commits made directly to `main`.
*   **Proposed:** Implement a standard branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or GitHub Flow).
    *   `main`: Represents production-ready, deployable code.
    *   `develop`: Integration branch for features.
    *   `feature/*`: Individual branches for new features or bug fixes.
    *   Utilize Pull Requests (PRs) for code review before merging into `develop` and subsequently `main`.

### 2. Automated Testing
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Implement unit tests for utility functions (e.g., in `src/lib/gemini-utils.ts`).
    *   Write unit tests for React components to verify their behavior in isolation.
    *   *Tools: Jest, React Testing Library.*
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Develop tests to verify the interaction between the frontend and the backend API (`/api/process-invoices`).
    *   *Tools: React Testing Library with MSW (Mock Service Worker) or dedicated integration testing tools.*
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   Create tests that simulate full user workflows (e.g., starting a batch, processing files, viewing results).
    *   *Tools: Playwright, Cypress.*

### 3. Continuous Integration (CI)
*   **Setup CI Pipeline:**
    *   Use GitHub Actions (create a workflow file, e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
*   **Pipeline Steps:**
    *   Trigger on pushes/PRs to `main` and `develop` (and feature branches if desired).
    *   Install dependencies (`npm ci` for speed and consistency).
    *   Run linters (ESLint is present) and code formatters (e.g., Prettier).
    *   Execute all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E).
    *   Build the application (`npm run build`) to catch build errors.
    *   (Optional) Perform dependency vulnerability scans (e.g., `npm audit` or GitHub Dependabot alerts).
    *   (Optional) Static code analysis.

### 4. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
*   **Deployment Platform:**
    *   Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Vercel is excellent for Next.js, Netlify, AWS Amplify, or custom cloud setup).
*   **Automated Deployments:**
    *   Configure the CI pipeline to automatically deploy to a staging environment upon successful merge to `develop`.
    *   Configure deployment to production upon successful merge/tag on `main`.
*   **Environment Variables & Secrets:**
    *   Utilize the chosen platform's secret management for `GEMINI_API_KEY` and other environment-specific configurations for different environments (dev, staging, prod).

### 5. Containerization (Optional Enhancement)
*   **Dockerfile:** Create a `Dockerfile` for building a container image of the Next.js application.
*   **Container Registry:** Store the image in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR).
*   This can simplify deployment consistency if moving beyond PaaS platforms like Vercel.

### 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (If applicable)
*   For deployments to cloud VMs or more complex setups, consider using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage infrastructure resources.

### 7. Monitoring & Logging (Production Focus)
*   Integrate dedicated logging (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, Datadog) and application performance monitoring (APM) tools for production environments to gain better insights into application behavior and errors.

## Immediate Polishing Steps / Next Actions

1.  **Update `README.md`:**
    *   Add project description, setup instructions (clone, install, `.env.local` setup), how to run, and key features.
2.  **Linting & Formatting:**
    *   Ensure ESLint is consistently applied.
    *   Consider adding Prettier and configuring it to work with ESLint for automated code formatting.
3.  **Basic CI Workflow (GitHub Actions):**
    *   Start with a simple workflow that installs dependencies, lints, and builds the project on pushes to `main`.
4.  **Branching Strategy Implementation:**
    *   Create a `develop` branch from `main`. Future feature work should branch from `develop`.
5.  **Initial Unit Tests:**
    *   Write a few basic unit tests for key functions in `src/lib/gemini-utils.ts`.

This plan provides a roadmap for enhancing the development and deployment lifecycle of the application.
